# Seasonal_Trading
This project demonstrates how to use https://github.com/TimRivoli/Stock-Price-Trade-Analyzer to evaluate a trading idea by backtesting the results with historical data.

In this case, we compare a BuyHold strategy against a trader who sells everything in October and buys again in March. 

Have fun and keep programming!
